# This file contains patterns for fixing complicated payee names in
# QBO files to simpler ones for the IIF import files.
#
# The string to match is on the left, then a tab, then on the right is
# the thing to replace it with. The program forces the match string to
# be anchored at the START of the payee name.
#
# (Yes, CHECKCARD xxxx is stripped out when matching the payee name at
# the start, so is PAYPAL *, SQ *, PP* and TST*)
#
# This may be necessary, for example, if different stores in the same
# chain append their store number after the company name, such as "CVS
# #123" and "CVS #456". Technically they are different stores, but
# they're really all just one vendor (CVS); you might want to change
# anything starting with CVS to just "CVS" so you don't end up with
# many slightly different vendor names in Quickbooks
#
# To review all payee names in the QBO file, and see if any need to be
# added here: egrep '<NAME>' name-of-qbo-file.QBO | sort | uniq
#
# Remember that after adding something here, you probably want to add
# an account mapping in the payees-to-accounts.txt file too.
#
# Do NOT add PAYPAL, it will produce an error when importing into QB
